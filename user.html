                <p>Hello Everyone! I am Nathan Flessner and I am just beginning my adventure into web development. I am currently participating in a Full-Stack coding bootcamp at the University of Denver. Through that I am currently learning HTML and CSS, with much more to come! I have a basic knowledge of C++ coming into this course, and just about nothing else other than some free courses on HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am looking to transition out of being a tehcnician for BMW, where I have worked for 5 years. In my free time I enjoy spending time with my wife and our two dogs in the beautiful outdoor world, and I am an aspiring astrophotographer! I am so excited for my journey into web development and how creative I can be with it. Thanks for looking!</p>
